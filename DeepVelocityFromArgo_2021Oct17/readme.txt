Details (available from its website):
North Atlantic observed climatological mean absolute geostrophic velocity components in meters per second from near the surface (pressure = 2.5 dbar) to near ocean bottom (pressure = 5562.0 dbar). The absolute velocity fields in the upper 2000 dbar of the water column were obtained by referencing an ARGO based mean geostrophic shear with mean velocity estimates at 1000 dbar between 2004-2016. The shear was derived using the so-called Roemmich-Gilson Argo climatology (Roemmich & Gilson, 2009). The referencing procedure was conducted using Argo displacement data referred to as YoMaHa'07 (Lebedev et al., 2007). For regions deeper than 2000 dbar, the velocity profiles were "extrapolated" using the geostrophic shear estimated from the World Ocean Atlas 2013 (WOA13) climatological dataset. The detailed methodology and uncertainty analysis is presented in Biló & Johns (2019).
